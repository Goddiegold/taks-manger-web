## Deploying to Vercel

Deploying your Next.js application to Vercel is simple and efficient. Follow these steps to get your app up and running:

### Prerequisites

- A Next.js project ready for deployment.
- A GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository for your project.
- A Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)).

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Push Your Code to a Git Repository**
   If you haven't done so, initialize Git and push your Next.js app to your preferred Git platform:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-nextjs-app.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Sign Up or Log In to Vercel**
   Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and log in using your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

3. **Create a New Project**
   - Click on **"New Project"** in the Vercel dashboard.
   - Select the repository for your Next.js app.

4. **Configure Project Settings**
   Vercel will auto-detect that it's a Next.js app. Review the default settings to ensure they’re correct.

5. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Navigate to the **"Environment Variables"** section.
   - Add the following variable:

     | Key               | Value | Environment |
     | ----------------- | ----- | ----------- |
     | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD` | `true` | All         |

6. **Deploy the Project**
   - Click the **"Deploy"** button. Vercel will build and deploy your app.
   - You’ll receive a unique live URL once the deployment is complete.

7. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - To set up a custom domain, navigate to your project’s **"Domains"** tab and follow the instructions.

### Post-Deployment Features

- **Automatic Deployments**: Vercel redeploys your app whenever you push changes to the connected branch.
- **Preview Deployments**: Each branch has a unique URL for testing before merging.
- **Serverless Functions**: Use Next.js API routes as serverless functions.
- **Analytics**: Monitor your app's performance and traffic.
